# School District Analysis
## Purpose and Background
We have been helping Maria clean and analyse school district data with the goal of showcasing trends in school performance. The data contained information about the schools as well as the students and their standardized test scores. Initially, this analysis was done (after cleaning the student names of fake prefixes and suffixes) with all student data. However, it was discovered that there was sufficient academic dishonesty amongst the ninth grade students of Thomas High School that their test scores would need to be removed from our analysis. The following is a summary of the comparison between the intial analysis and the analysis done after removing the dishonest test scores. 
## Results
* The [Updated School District Summary](https://github.com/MDaily7/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Challenge_District_Summary.png) is insignificantly different from [The Original School District Summary](https://github.com/MDaily7/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Module_District_Summary.PNG).
* The [Updated School Summary](https://github.com/MDaily7/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Challenge_School_Summary.png) is also very similar to the [Original School Summary](https://github.com/MDaily7/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Module_School_Summary.png) with only a few minor changes to Thomas High School. 
* Removing the ninth graders scores did nothing to change the schools performance relative to other schools as can be seen by comparing the [Updated Top Five Schools](https://github.com/MDaily7/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Challenge_TopFive.png) to the [Original Top Five Schools](https://github.com/MDaily7/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Module_TopFive.png).
* The only change in scores by grade is that the ninth graders for Thomas High School have no scores in the [Updated Math by Grade](https://github.com/MDaily7/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Challenge_ByGradeMath.png) or [Updated Reading by Grade](https://github.com/MDaily7/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Challenge_ByGradeReading.png) whereas they did in the [Original Math by Grade](https://github.com/MDaily7/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Module_ByGradeMath.png) and the [Original Reading by Grade](https://github.com/MDaily7/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Module_ByGradeReading.png). 
   * It is important to note that the ninth grade scores for Thomas High School seen in the originals are very similar to the scores for the other grades at that school. 
* [Updated Scores by Spending](https://github.com/MDaily7/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Challenge_BySpending.png) differ little from the [Original Scores by Spending](https://github.com/MDaily7/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Module_BySpending.png).
* [Updated Scores by Size](https://github.com/MDaily7/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Challenge_BySize.png) also did not change much for the [Original Scores by Size](https://github.com/MDaily7/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Module_BySize.png). 
* [Updated Scores by Type](https://github.com/MDaily7/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Challenge_ByType.png) did not change at all from the [Original Scores by Type](https://github.com/MDaily7/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Module_ByType.png).
## Summary
The most obvious change to the analysis is that that there are no ninth grade scores for Thomas High School, but it is difficult to discern any significant changes other than that. This makes sense however considering how similar the average math and reading scores for those ninth graders were to the other grades within Thomas High School. For example, we can see a slight change in Thomas High Schools average math and reading scores from the original scores as seen in the school summaries shown before, but the change is almost miniscule due to being an average of averages that are all extremely similar. Taking this into consideration, it is not surprising that there are no discernible differences when looking at scores by spending, size, or type as those ninth graders are an even smaller fraction of the overall scores. If you look a few decimal places out in the $630-644 spending category, the medium category, and the charter schools type, you can see some miniscule changes that are a result of removing those ninth graders, but these changes are rendered insignifcant even with the most cautious of reasonable rounding.
